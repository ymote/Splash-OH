//! UI state for the flutter kit — the ArkUI half.
//!
//! Deliberately a second copy of `splash-render/src/state.rs`, not a shared
//! dependency. The two backends do not share a VM: this crate walks the kit on
//! splash-core's, the makepad backend on splash-render's, and splash-oh-native
//! has no path to splash-render at all. Making one appear would mean a
//! cross-repo dependency from the ArkUI renderer onto the makepad one, which is
//! exactly the coupling the two-crate split exists to prevent.
//!
//! So the store is duplicated and the *behaviour* is what is kept identical —
//! same actions, same wrapping, same defaulting, same tests. A control that
//! checks on the phone checks on the desktop. If you change one, change both.
//!
